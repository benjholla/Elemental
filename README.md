# Elemental
An esoteric language for exploring elemental properties program language features

## Lineage
This language was inspired by [Brainfuck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck), which is a variation on [Corrado Böhm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corrado_Böhm)'s [P''](https://esolangs.org/wiki/P%E2%80%B2%E2%80%B2). Both languages however implement branching as a type of loop. 

## Differences
- Elemental seperates branching from looping
- Elemental has what could be thought of as either gotos and labels or callsites and functions
- Element has what could be thought of as either [computed gotos](http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Labels-as-Values.html) or function pointers
